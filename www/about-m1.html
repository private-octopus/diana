<h1>ITHI Metric M1, Inaccuracy of Whois Data</h1>

This set of metrics tracked the Inaccuracy of Whois Data, by measuring the number of
complaints validated in a given month. They were updated and published from 2017 to 2019.

<h1>ITHI Metric M1, Description of the old metrics</h1>
<p>
The metric M1 tracks the Inaccuracy of Whois Data, by measuring the number of
complaints validated in a given month. The compliance department of ICANN
receives a number of complaints every month. Out of that number, some will
be closed immediately, and some will be validated. When a complaint is validated,
ICANN will send a notice to the registrar for the domain. Complaints go through
a succession of stages:
</p>
<nl>
<li>Complaint is received by ICANN and examined. Some complaints are resolved
immediately, but some are validated and require follow-up.</li>
<li>When a complaint is validated, ICANN sends a first notice to the relevant
registry and registrar.</li>
<li>If the complaint is not resolved, ICANN will send further notices, and
may eventually take some corrective action.</li>
</nl>
<p>
We don't want to track the raw number of complaints received by ICANN, as the
number may contains complaints that are not actually valid. Instead, we track
the number of validated complaints by counting the notices sent each month,
i.e. at the second stage of the process. The first submetric just tries this
total number of complaints, divided by the total number of registered
domains:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>M1.1: number of validated complaints per 1,000,000 domains.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
We have found however that "the average does not tell the story". If everything was
equal, the number of complaints per registrar should be the value of the ratio
M1.1 multiplied by how many million domains this registrar manages. But that's not
the case. We plotted the cumulative frequency distribution of complaints per registrar
in January 2018, and it looks like this:

<p>
This is a classic "long tail" distribution. Most of the 1954 registrars have no complaints
at all, or maybe just a few. It takes only 6 registrars to account for 50% of all complaints,
and 44 to account for 90%. The simplest way to track this would be to provide a table of the 
registrars with the most complaints, but this would raise serious privacy concerns. Instead,
we chose to track the shape of the distribution with two submetrics:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>M1.2 = Smallest number of registrars explaining 50% of complaints.</li>
        <li>M1.3 = Smallest number of registrars explaining 90% of complaints.</li>
</ul>
<p>
